# De-Anza-Chess-Website
Website for the De Anza Chess Website.

## Changelog

08/14/2020 ~ Ayman: fixed file layout, fixed styling, made mobile friendly, got rid of unnecessary code/frameworks, fixed most of grammar/English structure mistakes. Currently waiting on a better logo, proper links, decision on PayPal, and better colors. After those are received the website will be good enough and any feature updates will depend on how much attention this club will receive. NOTE: there are a few mobile responsiveness issues at the moment. I am aware of those, and I will fix those once I receive the logo, other media, etc.
